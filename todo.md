## todo

- ~~add `reserve` functionality~~
- add `clear` functionality
  - is there a safe way to do this?
  - introduce container generation for extra safety? increment after each `clear` operation?
- consider special members (move only type?)
- add iterator support (begin/end interface?)
- add a way to distinguish handles from separate containers (?)
- investigate benchmarking code
