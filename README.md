# Experimental handle container in C++

Following on from [c-handle-container](https://github.com/pr0g/c-handle-container) this builds on the same ideas but supports a dynamic number of elements without a fixed capacity. It is also templated so arbitrary types can be supported.

Inspired by Bitsquid/Stringray blog post: [Managing Decoupling Part 4 -- The ID Lookup Table](http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/2011/09/managing-decoupling-part-4-id-lookup.html).
